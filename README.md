# 8_puzzle_problem
This project solves the 8 puzzle problem with A star algorithm. 
Algorithm uses Manhattan Distance and Wrong Tile as the heuristics.
Code consists of other uninformed search functions such as Depth First Search, Limited Depth Search, Iterative Deepening. But those functions are commented in the main function and not being used for this project.
